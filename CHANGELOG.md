## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2025-09-30

### Added
- Focus blocks now counted accurately (counts how many 3-hour blocks fit in each free slot)
- New metric: `total_focus_blocks` in summary showing total deep work capacity
- New metric: `focus_slots_count` to distinguish between number of slots vs number of blocks
- Display now shows total deep work hours available (`total_focus_blocks Ã— 3`)
- Versioning system with semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Cleanup script to remove temporary files before git commits
- Version number now displayed in CLI banner

### Fixed
- **BREAKING FIX**: Timezone handling - calendar queries now use local timezone instead of forcing UTC
  - Events are now correctly found regardless of system timezone
  - Fixes issue where events were missed due to timezone offset (e.g., 9am meeting wasn't found because query started at 10am local time)
- Free time calculation no longer spans across busy periods
  - Algorithm now properly excludes meetings from free time blocks
  - Example: Day with 9am meeting now shows 2 free slots (7-9am, 10am-8pm) instead of 1 slot (7am-8pm)
- Focus blocks count now reflects actual productivity capacity
  - 13-hour free day now correctly shows 4 focus blocks (was 1)

### Changed
