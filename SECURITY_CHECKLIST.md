# Security & Data Protection Checklist

## Current Security Measures âœ…

### API Security
- [x] API token stored in .env file (not in code)
- [x] .env file in .gitignore (not committed to repository)
- [x] No hardcoded credentials in any files
- [x] Bearer token authentication (industry standard)

### Data Protection
- [x] Task content is personal/work tasks (not financial/credential data)
- [x] Local processing only (no cloud storage of sensitive data)
- [x] Processed files archived with timestamps
- [x] No personal identifiers beyond task content

### Access Control
- [x] File system permissions restrict access to user account
- [x] API token scoped to Todoist tasks only
- [x] No network services exposed

## Potential Risks & Mitigations

### Low Risk
- **Task content exposure**: Tasks are personal/work items, not financial data
- **Mitigation**: Keep .env secure, don't share repository publicly

### Medium Risk  
- **API token compromise**: Could allow unauthorized Todoist access
- **Mitigation**: Rotate token periodically, monitor Todoist for unusual activity

### Negligible Risk
- **Local file access**: Requires physical/system access to your machine
- **Data loss**: Todoist is primary store, local files are processing artifacts

## Recommended Security Practices

### Immediate (Should Do)
1. **Token Rotation**: Change Todoist API token every 6 months
2. **Repository Privacy**: Keep git repository private if pushing to cloud
3. **File Permissions**: Ensure .env file is readable only by you
4. **Backup Strategy**: Regular Todoist export for data protection

### Advanced (Nice to Have)
1. **Token Encryption**: Encrypt .env file at rest
2. **Audit Logging**: Log all API operations for review
3. **Rate Limiting**: Add request throttling to prevent API abuse
4. **Validation**: Add input sanitization for task content

## Data Loss Prevention

### Current Safeguards
- **Primary storage**: Tasks stored in Todoist (cloud-backed)
- **Operation logging**: All changes archived in processed/ folder
- **Incremental updates**: Can reconstruct history from processed files
- **Reversible operations**: Most task changes can be manually undone

### Additional Recommendations
- **Weekly exports**: Download Todoist data backup
- **Git versioning**: Commit system changes (not data) to track evolution
- **Cloud sync**: Your Tresorit folder provides automatic backup

## Privacy Considerations
- **Local processing**: No task data sent to third parties beyond Todoist
- **Claude interaction**: Only structured JSON shared, not raw task content
- **Minimal exposure**: System designed for single-user, local operation

## Compliance Notes
- **Personal use**: System designed for individual productivity
- **No GDPR concerns**: Personal data under your control
- **No business compliance**: Consult IT if using for company tasks

## Action Items for Enhanced Security

### Immediate (Next Session)
- [ ] Verify .env file permissions (600 or 644)
- [ ] Check .gitignore includes all sensitive files
- [ ] Test API token validity

### Within 1 Week  
- [ ] Set calendar reminder for token rotation (6 months)
- [ ] Export current Todoist data as baseline backup
- [ ] Document recovery procedures

### Within 1 Month
- [ ] Review processed files for any sensitive data
- [ ] Consider repository privacy settings
- [ ] Evaluate need for additional encryption
